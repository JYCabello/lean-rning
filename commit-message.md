This is a project made for learning, thus commit messages will contain information about the language features being used, not about any business logic being implemented.

Notes as `feat:` or `refactor:` will not be included, because they are irrelevant.

The focus will be on the language features being used if it's a lean file. Exclusively on that. Nothing about readability or any other kind of reasons to make the change, this is a learning project, the use of any language feature happens uniquely because the user wants to learn about that feature.

This is critical: No comments as to why things are being done, exclusively mentions of which language features are being used.
